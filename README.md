# Student-Data-base-Mangement-sysytem
Developed as a console application without GUI, this student database system project uses file to store the students’ information mentioned in the features below. You need to compile the source code in Code::Blocks using the GCC compiler. The source code and application file can be directly downloaded from the link below.

Basic four features make up most of this project, but you can write your own code to add more features, and make this project more effective and better overall. You can add “Search Records” feature. Here’s a brief overview of the features:

Add Records
This feature allows you to add general information records. That includes the student’s name, course and section. All the added records in this student database management system are stored in file.
List Records
It lists all the added records from the first feature. There are some improvements you can make to this feature to make the list look more attractive.
Modify Records
This feature allows you to modify the added records. The modified records are stored in file.
Delete Records
This feature is for deleting the added students’ information from the file.
